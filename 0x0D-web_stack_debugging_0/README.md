### [0. Give me a page!](./0-give_me_a_page)

* Script to get Apache to run on the container holbertonschool/265-0 and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it.

* The original state of the server is that it returns `curl: (52) Empty reply from server` when you curl the port `8080` mapped to the Docker container port `80`, or in other words, it doesn't return a page but an error message.
